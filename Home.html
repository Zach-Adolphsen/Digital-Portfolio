<p class="home_p1" >Hello, my name is Zachary (Zach) Adolphsen. I am glad you're here! It is nice to meet you, kind of. Lets get into the introduction! Originally from the town of Alexandria, MN. I grew up camping with my family at the surrounding State Parks. Plot twist!, I don't really like the outdoors that much. I need there to be a shower nearby or I won't be a happy camper. Moving on... </p>

<p class="home_p2" color="white">I am a student at North Dakota State University(NDSU) going into my second year of school as of Fall 2024. I am studying Computer Science with the goal of attaining a Bachelors Degree. I started my college experience majoring in Computer Engineering but in my second year of school I realized that I am more interested in programming and with my little experience I have a pretty good thought process and problem solving skills for programming. So I thought, why not switch my major to something I am interested in and am decent at and have a lot to improve about.</p>
